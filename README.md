# MovieFeed
A simple movie-feed website showcasing a list of films with posters, titles, short descriptions, and ratings. The design should resemble a lightweight streaming service preview page: clean grid layout, responsive cards, and a minimal top header. The site acts as a visual gallery rather than a full app — no backend needed.
